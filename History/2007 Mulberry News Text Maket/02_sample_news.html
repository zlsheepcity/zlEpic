			<p>John Terry spoke for many Chelsea fans yesterday when he expressed his hope that winning the quadruple would make it impossible for the club to dispense with Jose Mourinho. The manager’s position remains precarious, despite his much-publicised hug with Roman Abramovich after the FA Cup semi-final win over Blackburn Rovers on Sunday, with the Russian still minded to replace him with a more attack-minded coach who would be easier to control.</p>

			<p>Although Terry was careful not to criticise the Chelsea owner, it is clear that his sympathy lies with Mourinho, the captain urging the club to “do the right thing” by the man who has led them to four leading trophies in 2? seasons. Chelsea could yet add a third Barclays Premiership title, a first Champions League and another FA Cup and Terry hopes that finishing the season with a shower of silverware will be enough to save Mourinho’s job.</p>

			<div class="rightnote">
				<p style="padding-bottom:0"><b>Barclays Premiership</b></p>

2 Chelsea	32	37	75	
3 Liverpool	33	28	61	
4 Arsenal	33	24	59	
5 Everton	34	16	54</pre>
			</div>
			
			<p>“No one will leave the club if we win the quadruple, definitely not,” he said. “I don’t see anyone leaving this summer at all. We are a tight-knit family and we want to keep it that way for many years. One thing we have at Chelsea is that we have been very much together over the last two or three years. That has got us where we are and is a big factor in our success.</p>

			<p>“Seeing the hug in the papers is great for every player. As a team, on the pitch and off the pitch, we are fully together and that’s the main thing. What goes on behind the scenes is not about us and all we can do is put in the right results and help people that way.”</p>
