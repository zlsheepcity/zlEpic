    <p>Cadmium3 is set of Terraform scripts, Helm charts and Jenkinsfile examples that together create and manage organization's AWS infrastructure. Current feature set is geared towards providing multiple fully functional development environments with GitOps CI/CD in Kubernetes inside separate AWS accounts. Reasonable effort was put into separating the code into modules, but the final intent was to make it work like a complete turn-key package.</p>

    <h2 class="h1">Kubernetes cluster</h2>
    <p class="h5">The cluster is a used as development environment and certain corners are cut in order to make it simple and usable. We assume that:</p>
    <ul class="box">
        <li>cluster users can tolerate minor downtimes. Spot Instances could be externally terminated, approximately once a month</li>
        <li>information and deployment doesn't need to be backed up. In case of a total disaster everything can be rebuilt from git repos which are presumed durable enough due to distributed nature of git</li>
        <li>authentication is enough. We don't offer fine grained authorization for the most services and role separation is more of guardrails and policies</li>
        <li>firewalls limit external access, but anyone on the office network can reach cluster internals</li>
